				" Last game was a management game focused on Psyren, Senators and Politics.",
				" This game will take place on Cathonia, a dark universe where the evil forces have already won. All humanity is already enslaved or destroyed by the numerous Overlords. The Overlords were able to destroy the previous civilizations and their protectors, with no “good guys to conquer” they turned against each other, bringing forward universal destruction and endless war. Time passed and as it usually goes, some individuals do better than others, thus new empires rose. Cathonia is so vast in territory and depth that Empires evolved into Dominions that fused into Cosmos which in turn opened new dimensions and realities. This event created a chain of command with no known end. Nowadays, nobody really knows who is really in control.",
				" You will partake in the first year of school at the University of Dark arts in Pandemonium, a “neutral city” of Cathonia and the Capital of Seven Hells (More about this region later). You will be a Dark Prince meaning the son/disciple of an Overlord. At university you will hopefully learn how to become a wise, ruthless conqueror. but most importantly how to survive in the hellhole that is Cathonia.",
				" Explore a new universe with different settings, values, lore etc. And for the first time you play as the “bad guys” kind off. You don't need to be evil but don't expect to change the world anytime soon. This game is merciless and begs for smart play, there is none to save you, no capsules, no John, no resurrection (at least not an easy one). Therefore is very important how you use your skills and how you interact with the world. To this end I made a quite interesting character creation.",
				" There is a very rich and interesting lore but I won't dump it all here. For now I will only explain things that are related to your origins and choices. If you want to know extra buying your own you can always read my replies to the other players and as always feel free to ask me anything. Like with all of my games, you can pace yourself having complex goals, exploring the lore and the universe. Or keep it simple do the minimum and enjoy the ride.",

With time they found new sources of power, opened new dimensions, evolved futher expanding their influence all over Cathonia.",
						" Seven Hells is one of the many Demon Heritage dominions spread all over Cathonia .As with most parts of Cathonia, Overlords fight for Dominion and influence. The place is called Seven Hells because of it Seven regions with very distinct cultures nature and influences and Overlords from all over Cathonia fighting for control. As with all Demonic Dominions Seven Hells has an entrance to the Abyss which extends all over Cathonia. Nobody knows is not clear who is the ruler of each Region or Seven Hells all together much less to know what is happening on the bottomless depths of the Abyss.",
						" Souls are the Currency of Seven Hells and most parts of Cathonia as well, although its value and business practices are different from place to place. A soul worth is dependent on its purity and power. Since purity is something lacking in Cathonia it's mostly the power that defines the value. An example of a ranking would be: ",
